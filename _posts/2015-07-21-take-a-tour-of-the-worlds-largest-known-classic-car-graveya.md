    description: 'But by her fourth album the stratospheric sales had faltered. When it came to her next release, her management mooted an album of Motown-inspired covers. Lewis disagreed.

description: "Nestled in a north Georgia forest, over 4,000 classic cars decorate 32 acres that have been turned into a junkyard museum. Owner Walter Dean Lewis' parents started the business in 1931 as a general store that also sold auto parts. Lewis grew the collection, which had just 40 cars in the '70s, over time."
